print("Key Differences That May Explain Performance Gap:")
print()

print("1. Batch Size Impact:")
print("   - Reference: 5 images/batch")
print("   - Ours: 8 images/batch")
print("   - Larger batches = more computation per batch on Pi")
print("   - Could explain slower per-batch time")
print()

print("2. Communication Overhead:")
print("   - Reference: Direct socket communication")
print("   - Ours: PyTorch RPC (adds serialization/deserialization overhead)")
print("   - But we showed network is only ~4ms, so this isn't the main issue")
print()

print("3. Throughput Calculation:")
print("   - Reference: throughput = batch_size / pi2_inference_time")
print("   - This measures Pi2's processing rate, not end-to-end")
print("   - Our 2.15 samples/s is end-to-end throughput")
print()

print("Recommendations:")
print("1. Test with batch_size=5 to match reference")
print("2. Measure Pi1 and Pi2 inference times separately")
print("3. Calculate throughput same way as reference for fair comparison")
print("4. Consider implementing direct socket communication if RPC overhead is significant")
